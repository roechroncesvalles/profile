REFLECTION: "My Online Class Journey"
</div>
<br>

<div style="border: 2px solid Tomato"> <i> Due to the current world health crisis, many Filipino students are compelled to engage in Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in order to continue with their studies, and the concept of ubiquitous learning (that is, learning anywhere, everywhere, anytime and every time) has been realized sooner than expected for many. As a student engaged in online learning, I would like you to reflect on your current situation as a learner. Write about the challenges you encounter every day, the funny moments you experienced, and personal suggestions as to how the learning process can be improved. You may also take a picture of your study room or take a screenshot of fun moments with your classmates etc.</i> </div> <br>

<div id="answer">
For me, online classes has been a hard time especially because I have internet problems in the morning and also that theres power outages in our area. While it is often frustrating, there are times that it's fun, like we can code in ourself, we can watch YouTube videos when we need because we have internet, and many more. While I have mixed feelings about online classes, it's the only thing students can have while on the pandemic. I hope that everything will be okay soon and that we can return back to our normal face-to-face classes.
